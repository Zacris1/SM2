<h1 style="text-align: center;color: blue;font-size:30px;">PS5 info</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">Spider-man 2 is an amazing game in my opinion and you should definitly play it</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">but there is some information you might need to know or just want to know and</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">that is what this site is for. The first thing you need to know is that Spider</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">-man 2 is only available on the Playstation 5. Not available on PC, Nintendo,</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">Xbox and not even on ps4 and you might ask why is that the case. It is a PS</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">exclusive so it make sense why it is not on any other platforms, but why not</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">on the ps4. That is basically because the ps4 is outdatet and the ps5 is just</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">better. Simple as that. But what does the ps5 cost then, i hear you ask through</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">the screen. Well the price depends on the version of the ps5. There is two types</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">of ps5's. There is the normal ps5 and the ps5 digital edition. The only difference</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">is that ps5 digital edition does not have a disc drive. The price range for the</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">digital version is about 500-600 dollars and the normal is about 700-800 dollars</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: center;color: rgb(204, 12, 12);font-size:30px;">General info</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">Spider-man 2 came out on October 20. 2023. It had huge expecations since it was</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">a sequel to both Spider-man ps4 and Spider-man Miles Morales which had been very</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">good games prior. The game was recived as a very good game, but people had some</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">issues with it. If it was better than the original is people divided on(Personally I</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">it was better than the first game). Spider-man 2 was made by Insomniac Games that</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">also made the two first Spider-man games as well as some other known games as</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">Spyro, Rachet and Clank and Sunset Overdrive. On IMDb is Spider-man 2 rated 9,4</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">stars with their highest rated video game on their site being Witcher 3 with 9,7</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">Spider-man 2 is an 3D action adventure game with a story. You can also kind of</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">call it a platformer because of the web swinging. The rate of frames per second</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">is 30. Spider-man 2 costs about 60-70 dollars, for the standard game edition. I</h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;color: white;font-size:20px;">hope that this helped you with learning a bit more about the game</h1>
